 - Use combination of functional button on left top corner and one of the 14 notes button to ply pre-recorded melody

### Two versions of project
There are two versions of this project.

First version with functional button. For playing loaded melodies push function button and one of note button together. Each note button has own melody.

Second version is without function button. Instead of it use two right buttons in down row. Else notes buttons are responsible for different melodies.
